Student Exam Management Application:

This is a C application that manages student exam information in a secure and robust manner. It allows the user to enter the number of students, their names and scores, and the subject of the exam. The program then calculates the total score, and saves the information to a file. To ensure the security of user data, this application has been designed to mitigate some common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

To use the program, simply run the executable file and follow the prompts on the screen.
