Secure Student Exam Management Application
This is a C application that manages student exam information in a secure and robust manner. The application provides functionalities to add, modify, and delete student records, as well as search and display student records.To ensure the security of user data, this application has been designed to mitigate common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.


Mitigation Strategies
To protect user data, it is important to implement the following strategies:

Use data types that are appropriate for the range of values being represented.
Limit the amount of data that can be written to a buffer to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
Use functions that can handle strings safely to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent format string attacks and command injection attacks.
Control access to shared resources to prevent race condition attacks.
By implementing these mitigation strategies, this application provides a secure solution for managing student exam information. These measures protect user data from potential attacks and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.

please create  a secure c  application used to manage student exam information. It has to show 5 vulnerabilities, which should be integer overflow, buffer overflow, race condition, command injection and format string attack. it must include all 5, and also show a resolution for each vulnerability.
